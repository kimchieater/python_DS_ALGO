# python_DS_ALGO
This is for Data Structure and algo questions 

Lesson 1: 

Binaray Search, Linked lists and complexity and about steps that you need to take in order to succesfully understand any questions.

first of all, 

Why is Data structure and algorithms Important? and why should you learn it?

  - you can think about a problem systematically, and solve it step by  step
  - envision different inputs, outputs, and edge cases
  - can communicate ideas clearly
  - convert your vision and ideas into working code more efficiently


Steps that you need to take :



- state the problem clearly. Identify inputs and outputs
- come up with some example inputs and outputs. try to cover all edge cases
- come up with a correct solution for the problem. state it in plain english
- implement the solution and test it using example inputs.
- analyze the algortithm's complexity and identify inefficiencies.
- apply the right technique to overcome the inefficiency.
