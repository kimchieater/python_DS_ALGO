Binary search is pretty much when you know that the cards are all sorted in decreasing order,

you first check the number of the card in the middle,

then you check if the number that you have is the one in the middle. 

if its not? then check if the value is greater or less 

if the value is greater than middle start +1

if the value is less than middle then do -1
